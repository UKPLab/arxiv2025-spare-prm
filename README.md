This is the official template for new Python projects at UKP Lab. It was adapted for the needs of UKP Lab from the excellent [python-project-template](https://github.com/rochacbruno/python-project-template/) by [rochacbruno](https://github.com/rochacbruno).

It should help you start your project and give you continuous status updates on the development through [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).

> **Abstract:** Process or step-wise supervision has played a crucial role in advancing complex multi-step reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, efficient, high-quality automated process annotation remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce **S**ingle-**P**ass **A**nnotation with **R**eference-Guided **E**valuation (**SPARE**), a novel structured framework that enables single-pass, per-step annotation by aligning each solution step to one or multiple steps in a reference solution, accompanied by explicit reasoning for evaluation. We show that reference-guided step-level evaluation effectively facilitates process supervision on four datasets spanning three domains: mathematical reasoning, multi-hop compositional question answering, and spatial reasoning. We demonstrate that *SPARE*, when compared to baselines, improves reasoning performance when used for: (1) fine-tuning models in an offline RL setup for inference-time greedy-decoding, and (2) training reward models for ranking/aggregating multiple LLM-generated outputs. Additionally, *SPARE* achieves competitive performance on challenging mathematical datasets while offering 2.6 times greater efficiency, requiring only 38% of the runtime, compared to tree search-based automatic annotation.

## Getting Started

> **DO NOT CLONE OR FORK**

If you want to set up this template:

1. Request a repository on UKP Lab's GitHub by following the standard procedure on the wiki. It will install the template directly. Alternatively, set it up in your personal GitHub account by clicking **[Use this template](https://github.com/rochacbruno/python-project-template/generate)**.
2. Wait until the first run of CI finishes. Github Actions will commit to your new repo with a "âœ… Ready to clone and code" message.
3. Delete optional files: 
    - If you don't need automatic documentation generation, you can delete folder `docs`, file `.github\workflows\docs.yml` and `mkdocs.yml`
    - If you don't want automatic testing, you can delete folder `tests` and file `.github\workflows\tests.yml`
    - If you do not wish to have a project page, delete folder `static` and files `.nojekyll`, `index.html`
4. Prepare a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install .
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt # Only needed for development
```
5. Adapt anything else (for example this file) to your project. 

6. Read the file [ABOUT_THIS_TEMPLATE.md](ABOUT_THIS_TEMPLATE.md)  for more information about development.

## Usage

### Using the classes

To import classes/methods of `arxiv2025_repa_prm` from inside the package itself you can use relative imports: 

```py
from .base import BaseClass # Notice how I omit the package name

BaseClass().something()
```

To import classes/methods from outside the package (e.g. when you want to use the package in some other project) you can instead refer to the package name:

```py
from arxiv2025_repa_prm import BaseClass # Notice how I omit the file name
from arxiv2025_repa_prm.subpackage import SubPackageClass # Here it's necessary because it's a subpackage

BaseClass().something()
SubPackageClass().something()
```

### Using scripts

This is how you can use `arxiv2025_repa_prm` from command line:

```bash
$ python -m arxiv2025_repa_prm
```

### Expected results

After running the experiments, you should expect the following results:

(Feel free to describe your expected results here...)

### Parameter description

* `x, --xxxx`: This parameter does something nice

* ...

* `z, --zzzz`: This parameter does something even nicer

## Development

Read the FAQs in [ABOUT_THIS_TEMPLATE.md](ABOUT_THIS_TEMPLATE.md) to learn more about how this template works and where you should put your classes & methods. Make sure you've correctly installed `requirements-dev.txt` dependencies
